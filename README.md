# Ionic 2 Webpack Starter

Ionic 2 starter project using Webpack 2 and [@ngtools/webpack](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/tree/master/packages/webpack) for AoT template compilation.

Includes Sass support for [theming your app](https://ionicframework.com/docs/v2/theming/theming-your-app/).

## Motivation

The [Ionic CLI](http://ionicframework.com/docs/cli/) is the officially supported tool for creating and managing Ionic projects. So why use a custom project workflow instead? Here are my reasons:

* Isolate the project from possible breaking changes in the [Ionic CLI](https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-cli) and related moving parts, i.e. [ionic-app-scripts](https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-app-scripts), [ionic2-app-base](https://github.com/driftyco/ionic2-app-base), etc.
* Build as a web app or a Cordova mobile app, with slightly different settings. E.g. `cordova.js` should not be included when deploying to a web server.
* Encapsulate styles in components the Angular way, i.e. using `styleUrls`, instead of requiring Sass rules to match the component `selector`.
* Follow the Angular [style guide](https://angular.io/styleguide#!#02-02) convention for file naming.

In other words, have full control over the build process.

## Usage

### Clone This Project

Simply clone this project and use it as it is, or rename it to whatever you like.
```
git clone https://github.com/mirkonasato/ionic2-webpack2-starter my-app
```

### Install Dependencies

Install all the dependencies (this only needs to be done once) with NPM:
```
cd my-app
npm install
```
(You can also use [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) instead of NPM of course.)

### Add Cordova

If you only want to create a (progressive) web app you can skip this step. To be able to build a mobile app with Cordova, create a new Cordova project in a `cordova` sub-folder using the [Cordova CLI](https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/guide/cli/) (did I say Cordova enough times?):

```
cordova create cordova
```

then edit `cordova/config.xml` and set your app id, name, etc.

### Local Development Server

To start a local development web server with automatic refresh type:
```
npm run serve
```
Your application will be accessible at [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/) by default. See the [webpack-dev-server docs](https://webpack.github.io/docs/webpack-dev-server.html) if you want to customise anything.

### Build Targets

* `npm run build` - builds the project as a (progressive) web app inside the `dist` folder.
* `npm run build:prod` - same as above but with production settings, i.e. it enables Angular production mode, Ahead-of-Time template compilation, and code obfuscation/minification.
* `npm run build:cordova` - prepares the project for building a mobile app with Cordova. The output in this case is the `cordova/www` folder.
* `npm run build:cordova:prod` - same as above but with production settings.

### Running as a Mobile App

Simply build the project as described above, then use [Cordova CLI](https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/guide/cli/) from inside the `cordova` sub-folder to build and run.

E.g. for Android build the project in the top-level folder
```
npm run build:cordova
```
add Android as a platform (only needs to be done once):
```
cd cordova
cordova platform add android
```
and then you run the app in an emulator with
```
cordova emulate android
```

For iOS it's the same, just replace `android` with `ios`. Please refer to the [Cordova CLI docs](https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/guide/cli/) for the full list of available commands.

### LiveReload in Android/iOS

To automatically reload the app at every change while running it in Android/iOS launch
```
npm run serve:cordova
```
this will start the dev server and create a special build in `cordova/www` with `index.html` set to load scripts from the dev server, using your machine external IP address.

In another terminal deploy the app to Android/iOS as usual with e.g.
```
ionic emulate android
```

You can even deploy to multiple devices and they will all live reload any changes.
